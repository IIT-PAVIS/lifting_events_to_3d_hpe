This is a sub-function of importAedat. 
This function processes the headers of an Aedat file. 
(as well as any attached prefs files). 
The .aedat file format is documented here:
http://inilabs.com/support/software/fileformat/
    
2015_12_11 Work in progress: 
- Reading from a separate prefs file is not implemented yet.  
- It would be neater (more readable) to turn the xml cell array into a
    structure.
